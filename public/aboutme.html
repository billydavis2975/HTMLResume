    <h2>About me</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My name is William, but I’ve always gone by Billy! I was born and raised
      in St. Petersburg, FL. When I’m not sharpening my dev skills, you can
      usually find me spending time with my wife, Isaidys, and our dog, Normie.
      My hobbies include working out, fantasy football, listening to music,
      reading, and veganizing my favorite recipes!
